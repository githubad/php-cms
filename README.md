# Old
Also hosted with free 000webhost service
Public Demo Link: https://githubad.000webhostapp.com/cms
Admin Demo Link: https://githubad.000webhostapp.com/cms/login.php


# Please Note
The code works perfectly fine on a local server and the paid hosting, but with this free 000webhost service, there's a redirection issue in demo link. So after you login, please manually check https://githubad.000webhostapp.com/cms/staff.php

# .SQL
Attached is a .sql file in codebase, for you to directly export it with PHPmyAdmin to make the overall app work. You just need to change the constants.php under includes folder to change the connection settings.
